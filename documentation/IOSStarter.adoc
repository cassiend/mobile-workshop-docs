NOTE: This document is a work in progress


== Setting up Xcode with Carthage using Alamofire, Quick and Nimble

* Select File → New → Project.

* Do not create a git repo at this point. If you are using version control, it is preferable to manage that via the command line.

* Go to File → Save As Workspace and save it in the same directory as your Xcode project with the same name.
* Put the project in a workspace so you can add Carthage dependencies as submodules (they must be in a workspace for Xcode to compile).

* Close the Xcode project with File → Close Project.
* Open the workspace with File → Open.
* Click on Project and open Manage Schemes...

* Check the Share box. This ensures that your changes apply across the project (i.e. with teammates), not just to your user settings.

* If you are using git to track your work, create a `.gitignore` file and add the following file types to ignore from git repository
----
# Xcode

## Build generated
build/
DerivedData/

## Various settings
*.pbxuser
!default.pbxuser
*.mode1v3
!default.mode1v3
*.mode2v3
!default.mode2v3
*.perspectivev3
!default.perspectivev3
xcuserdata/

## Other
*.moved-aside
*.xcuserstate

## Obj-C/Swift specific
*.hmap
*.ipa
*.dSYM.zip
*.dSYM

## Playgrounds
timeline.xctimeline
playground.xcworkspace

# Swift Package Manager
#
# Add this line if you want to avoid checking in source code from Swift Package Manager dependencies.
# Packages/
.build/

# CocoaPods
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:

# fastlane
#
# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the
# screenshots whenever they are needed.

* Install Carthage
----
brew install carthage
----

* Create a Cartfile

image::image8.png[]

* Add Alamofire to Cartfile:

image::image9.png[]

----
github "Alamofire/Alamofire" ~> 4.4.0
----

* Create a Cartfile.private
* Add Quick and Nimble to Cartfile.private:

image::image10.png[]

----
github "Quick/Quick" ~> 1.1.0
github "Quick/Nimble" ~> 6.0.1
----

#!/usr/bin/env sh

if ! command -v carthage > /dev/null; then
  printf 'Carthage is not installed.\n'
  printf 'See https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage for install instructions.\n'
  exit 1
fi

carthage update --platform iOS

* Adding Dependencies to the Workspace
** Navigate to the Project Settings -> "Build Phases" section
** Select the correct target from the left panel (e.g. IOSMVCExampleTests for Quick and Nimble)
** Open Carthage/Build/IOS, and drag the built frameworks to 'Linked Frameworks and Libraries'

image::image15.png[]
image::image16.png[]

* Navigate to the Project Settings -> "Build Phases" section
* Add a “New Copy Files Phase”

image::image17.png[]

* Go down to the “Copy Files” section
* Under “Destination” select “Frameworks”

image::image18.png[]

* Select the framework suitable for each target

image::image19.png[]

* In the end, you should have the libraries setup in each target (repeat for each one)

image::image20.png[]

== Adding Your First Test File
 * Right click on your test target to add "New File..."

image::add_new_test_file.png[]

* Scroll down to the "Quick Templates" section. Select "Quick Spec Class", then follow the prompt to name your new file.

image::select_quick_spec_class.png[]
image::name_spec.png[]

* Begin testing. Quick and Nimble follow a BDD-style pattern using `describe` and `it`. See the documentation examples http://quick.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quick-examples-and-example-groups[here].

== Introducing Fastlane
* If you don't have fastlane installed, get it with

image::brew_install_fastlane.png[]

* To begin:

image::fastlane_init.png[]

* Open your Fastfile

image::open_fastfile.png[]

* Add a new lane for building

image::add_lane.png[]
----
desc "Build artifact"
  lane :build_artifact do
    gym(scheme: "IOSStarter", workspace: "IOSStarter.xcworkspace")
  end
----

* Run your lane to build

image::fastlane_build.png[]

** If you encounter codesigning issues (exit code 65):
*** Add a lane to Fastfile for signing and run this lane

image::sign_lane.png[]

----
desc "Codesign"
lane :sign do
  cert
  sigh
  gym(scheme: "IOSStarter", workspace: "IOSStarter.xcworkspace")
end
----
image::run_sign_lane.png[]



* Add parameters to scan in your test lane

image::fastlane_test.png[]

----
desc "Runs all the tests"
  lane :test do
    scan(scheme: "IOSStarter", workspace: "IOSStarter.xcworkspace", device: "iPhone 7", test_without_building: false)
  end
----

== Running test using Fastlane in Jenkins
----
brew update && brew install jenkins
brew services start jenkins
