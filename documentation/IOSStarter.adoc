This journey begins one late Monday afternoon in Antwerp.
Our team desperately needs coffee, but none of us dare open the office door.

To leave means code dismemberment and certain death.

Select File → New → Project.



Go to File → Save As Workspace and save it in the same directory as your Xcode project with the same name.
Put the project in a workspace due to adding Carthage dependencies as submodules (they must be in a workspace for Xcode to compile) +

Close the Xcode project with File → Close Project.
Open the workspace with File → Open.
Click on Project and open Manage Schemes...


Check the Share box


Create a .gitignore file and add the following file types to ignore from git repository





github "Alamofire/Alamofire" ~> 3.4



github "Quick/Quick" ~> 0.9.2
github "Quick/Nimble" ~> 4.1.0











Adding Dependencies to the Workspace

+

Since our dependencies are submodules, we need to add them to our workspace.
Open up Carthage/Checkouts and add each dependency’s .xcodeproj to the root of the workspace. They can be dragged from Finder into the navigator of the Xcode project.

When you’re done it should look like:



Link Runtime Dependencies
With “IOSStarter” selected in the Navigator and the “IOSStarter” target selected on the middle sidebar, select the “Build Phases” tab and expand the “Link binary with libraries” section.
+
Click the “+” icon and select the Alamofire.framework from the Alamofire IOS target.
+
Click “Add”.



Link Development Dependencies
Select the “IOSStarterTests” target from the middle sidebar.
+
Using the same process as before, add the Quick and Nimble frameworks to the “Link binary with libraries” section for this target.
+

When adding dependencies to each target, Xcode will automatically add them to the “Framework Search Paths” under the “Build Settings” tab. We can remove these from the “IOSStarter” and “IOSStarterTests” target because Xcode treats them as implicit dependencies due to them being in the same workspace.
+
Select the target, locate the “Framework Search Paths” setting, highlight it, and press “backspace” on your keyboard.


Next, look in the “IOSStarter” project in the Navigator; you’ll see there are three new frameworks in Frameworks:


brew update && brew install jenkins
brew services start jenkins
